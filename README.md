# Machine Learning Course
An 11-WEEK course (55-hour) provided by Stanford University on Coursera and explained by Andrew Ng. The course gives a broad introduction to machine learning, data-mining, and statistical pattern recognition.

## Topics Covered
* Supervised learning 
   * Parametric/non-parametric algorithms
   * Support vector machines
   * Kernels
   * Neural Networks
* Unsupervised learning
   * Dimensionality reduction
   * Recommender systems
   * Deep learning
* Best practices in machine learning 
   * Bias/variance theory
   * Innovation process in machine learning and AI

## Repo Contents
* Lectures of the instructor 
* Programming Assignments
* My brief notes during the course

> Most of notes in notes document are copied from the lectures, my own notes are added as comment lines between /\* \*/ so they may contain incorrect info
